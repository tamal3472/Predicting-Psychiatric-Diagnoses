# Predicting Psychiatric Diagnoses in Undergraduate Students

## Background
Description of the data from the source:

The University Student Mental Health data was gathered during the fall of 2020. This online survey included sections on demographics, mental health, changes in mental health during the pandemic, self-care habits (sleep, exercise, emotion regulation, social support, and mindfulness), and both recreation (athletics, partying, games, and watching online videos) and academic hobbies (studying, participating in academic organizations, attending office hours, and using educational resources).

Basically, the researchers created an online survey using the Qualtrics platform, and solicited responses from participants who were self-reported as university students registered in a four-year undergraduate program in Canada. This survey asked a large number of questions, intended to paint a full picture of each participant's life and mental health status at that point in time.

The dataset gives us the opportunity to build a machine learning model which can predict university students' mental health diagnoses in the context of an unprecendented global pandemic. And so the problem we tackle in this project will be predicting university students' mental health in the context of a large-scale upheaval.

If we are better able to predict mental health outcomes in such situations, this would allow us to better handle any future such upheavals (i.e. another pandemic or other global emergency). A university, in particular, would be able to use such a model to preemptively identify students at risk of suffering poor mental health outcomes in such situations, and take measure to ameliorate any bad outcomes before they happen
